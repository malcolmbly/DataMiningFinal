# Supervised Learning Final

In this project, I use the phishing URL datasaet from UCI's repo https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/967/phiusiil+phishing+url+dataset.
The goal was to test how easily we can identify phishing url's, which if possible, would significantly help us
protect people who are more vulnerable on the internet from malicious actors.
The dataset is quite large with over 200k rows, but is quite clean and free of missing values.
It comes with many columns that analyze various aspects of the URL. By using a random forest classifier, we demonstrate
that predicting malicious websites is quite possible, although there's certainly still a small chance of both false positives
and false negatives, as demonstrated lower in the report.
